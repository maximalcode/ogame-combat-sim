// maxi-quality — TypeScript ESLint baseline (flat config, type-aware)
//
// USAGE — a consuming project's own eslint.config.mjs is ~3 lines:
//
//   import base from '@maximalcode/maxi-quality/configs/typescript/eslint.config.mjs';
//   export default [...base, { /* project-specific overrides here */ }];
//
// Until this repo is published to npm, point at it directly — a file: devDep,
// a git devDep, or a relative import from a sibling checkout:
//
//   import base from '../../configs/typescript/eslint.config.mjs';
//   export default [...base];
//
// The consuming project needs these devDependencies:
//   eslint  @eslint/js  typescript-eslint  typescript
//
// Type-aware linting is ON (projectService). That means every linted file must
// be covered by a tsconfig.json in the project root. If your tsconfig lives
// elsewhere, override tsconfigRootDir in your own config:
//
//   export default [...base, {
//     languageOptions: { parserOptions: { tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname } },
//   }];

  // Adopted on measurement, not reputation (docs/EVAL-vs-oss-tools.md §2b, #11):
  // it contributes FIVE bug classes typescript-eslint has no counterpart for —
  // both if/else branches identical, two functions with identical bodies, a
  // collection read but never filled, a catastrophic-backtracking regex, and
  // `eval` on a non-literal. Each is baited in samples/typescript/src/sonarjs.ts.
  //
  // `recommended` (217 of 279 rules), NOT all 279. Measured: all-279 puts two
  // findings on samples/typescript-clean — `file-header` and
  // `arrow-function-convention`, both rules that need options nobody supplied —
  // and this repo's own rule is that a config which flags the clean fixture has
  // regressed. All-279 would have raised Layer 2 TS coverage from 4/30 to 10/30,
  // so it is a real trade and it is refused on the clean-fixture rule.
